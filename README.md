# New React App With Hooks

This is a basic configuration files which provide us zero config like create-react-app. I add some dev dependencies which provide easy development Enviroment and also configure eslint for vsCode or etc Code Editor to check our code for error Without checking after patching aur compiling entire project on browser. I also add some rules in eslint.

This configuration for Reach with Hooks or also React without Hooks.
